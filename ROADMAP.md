# Ideas

##### Simple models

1. calibrated predictors;
1. add more models to the stack:
    - linear models (SGD),
    - tree-based models (RF, ETC, GBM, LGBM, CB),
    - Bayes models,
    - KNN;
1. add more 2nd level models;
1. add 3rd level model;
1. ensembling - bagging, voting etc.

##### Features

1. hashing vectorizer;
1. stemming and/or lemmatization in existing pipelines;
1. word2vec-based features;
1. topic modelling.

##### More complicated models

1. LSTM;
1. (Hidden) Markov chain model;
1. NLP in R.

##### Anything else?

1. tune parameters of models.
